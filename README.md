# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
This program helps in visualizing sorting algorithms over a random set of elements, using blocks of varying height that are sorted using different algorithms. In this program i have used pygame, to visualize an array with array values representing the height of the blocks. The blocks are arranged in a random manner, which can be sorted using respective commands for different algorithms.

The output window looks like this.
Changes to be made:
1. The sorting needs to be automated, to avoid pressing the repective input buttons again and again.
2. Better animations, for better understanding.
3. More Sorting Algorithms.
